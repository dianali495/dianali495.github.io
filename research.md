##### Welfare Analysis of WIC Subsidy Program in the Infant Formula Market

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides vouchers for specific foods to improve nutrition among at-risk beneficiaries. While effective, questions remain about optimizing the program to enhance social welfare. I estimates the demand for WIC in the infant formula market using a discrete choice model and Nielsen Consumer Panel Data, focusing on two key aspects: the effect of expanding the variety of WIC-eligible products and the impact of increasing participation among eligible households. I find that the current WIC program significantly benefits participants, with eligible households potentially doubling their consumer surplus upon joining. Furthermore, increasing the variety of WIC-eligible products could lead to a 17\% rise in consumer surplus for current participants. This research underscores the critical value of WIC and provides an evaluation of various strategies to improve the program, enabling informed decision-making.
